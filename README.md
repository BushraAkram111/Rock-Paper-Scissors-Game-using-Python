Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

Description

I am practicing Python programming, and I have created a basic Rock, Paper, Scissors game. This command-line game allows the user to play against the computer. The user inputs their choice, and the computer randomly selects its choice. The program then determines the winner based on the standard rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors.


How to Play

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is located.

Follow the on-screen prompts to enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors).

The computer will randomly select its choice.

The program will display the choices and announce the winner.

You will be prompted to play again or exit the game.

Rules

Rock beats Scissors.

Scissors beats Paper.

Paper beats Rock.

If both choices are the same, it's a tie.
